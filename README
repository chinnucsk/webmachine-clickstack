This is designed to work with webmachine - https://github.com/basho/webmachine

To run webmachine on cloudbees: 
 - create your own webmachine project - as per quick start on https://github.com/basho/webmachine
 - run the following in the project directory
   (and maybe write some code!)

    make
    zip -r ../app.zip *
    bees app:deploy -t webmachine ../app.zip

That will use this here clickstack. (you don't need to clone what is here)

Notes: 

this patches the supervisor and the start script for the 
webmachine generated project.
