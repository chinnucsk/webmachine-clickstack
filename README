This is designed to work with webmachine - https://github.com/basho/webmachine

To run webmachine on cloudbees: 
 - create your own webmachine project - as per quick start on https://github.com/basho/webmachine
 - run the following in the project directory
   (and maybe write some code!)

    make
    zip -r ../app.zip *
 

 bees app:deploy -a playground/webmachine -t webmachine -RPLUGIN.SRC.webmachine=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudbees-downloads/clickstack/webmachine-clickstack.zip ../webmachine_demo_app.zip serverPool=pool-431


That will use this here clickstack. (you don't need to clone what is here)

Notes: 

this patches the supervisor and the start script for the 
webmachine generated project.
